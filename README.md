## Description
Genetic Algorithm is one of the evolutionary algorithms. This kind of algorithm allows to resolve many problems thanks to the evolutionary model with different modifications during the stages of the life cycle. For my purpose i have used the genetic algorithm for resolving salesman travelling problem. Genetic algorithms are searching the large space of solutions and choosing the best one. As you can see on the graph <...>, the best solution is only the local best solution, not the global one. In my case the quality of the best local solution depends of the number of algorithm's iterations. The genetic algorithm that i have implemented consists of the following steps:
1.
